The three files here represent the process to create a dataset based on the 3-body orbits and training three neural networks (a MLP, a GRU and a transformer with multi-head attention).

-The "Simulation" file is the python script to create the database as a list of matrices.
-The "Neural Networks" file is the Jupiter script to use the created dataset to train the three networks

-The "Animation" file is an additional one that can be used to see the dynamics of the three bodies for different initializations
